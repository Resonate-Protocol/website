<h2>
  Resonate is an open protocol for the complete music listening experience.
</h2>

<p>
  Resonate is an open standard for synchronized music experiences across
  multiple devices. It enables speakers, lights, and screens to work together to
  create a rich and immersive audio environment:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio in sync across multiple speakers</li>
  <li>Visualize audio playback on connected lights</li>
  <li>Offer music control and metadata from tablets or screens</li>
</ul>

<h3>See it in action</h3>

  <i> TODO: Add demo video or interactive example here. </i>
</p>

<h3>Adopted by the following projects</h3>

<div class="projects">

    </div>
    <div class="name">Music Assistant (beta)</div>
  </a>

<h3>Roles in a Resonate network</h3>

<p>
  Resonate supports different device roles to create a complete listening
  experience:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Speaker</b> – Speaker, phone or anything else that plays the audio</li>
  <li>
    <b>Visualizer</b> – Devices that will visualize the played audio. This can
    be an LED strip, TouchDesigner plugin or a Winamp style visualization app on
    a computer
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Remote</b> – Devices that can display the current metadata and allow the
    user to control the music
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why (yet another) new protocol?</h3>

<p>
  <b
    >All existing audio standards are closed and focus on getting audio to play
    on multiple speakers simultaneously.</b
  >
</p>

<p>
  In the end, existing protocols focus solely on moving bytes around – getting
  audio data from one device to another for synchronized playback.
</p>

<p>
  Resonate takes a different approach by focusing on the music listening
  experience itself. It takes a comprehensive look at what listening to audio
  means and makes sure that all activities are covered – not just audio
  playback, but also metadata distribution, visualization, and control across
  all your devices.
